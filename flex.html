                        The backpack pictured is one for longer hikes allowing you to store lots of
                        extra clothing and special items. <br><br> The backpack you may choose may be smaller or

                    <p style="display:none;" id="boots_info"> Probably the most important accessories
                        for going hiking would be proper footwear. <br><br> Now for some hikes such as those that are
                        shorter in distance or on paved trails, a good pair of sneakers is all that is necessary.
                        But for any long distance trail that is over rough or uneven terrain, a pair of hiking
                        boots can go a long way. <br><br> Boots help prevent you from turning your ankle over roots or rocks
                        as well as providing stronger grip on more slick surfaces.

                        to stay on marked trails or in areas not far from roads this is not as important, but if you wish
                        to go deep-woods hiking or in areas with limited cellular connection you're going to want this.
