                    <h1>What is Hiking?</h1>
                    <p> To start off, hiking is the activity of going on long walks, 
                        often through the country or woods, but is not limited to these areas.
                        <br><br>
                        Hiking can be as strenous as you'd like it to be, with simple hikes like
                        trekking through a nearby park, or pushing yourself to the limit on a multi-day
                        expedition through the mountains.
                        <br><br>
                        You need not any background or prior experience to start your first hike, just
                        search for a place and go (as long as you have the appropriate gear)
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="hiking_search">

                    <h1>Looking Prepare for Your Next Hike?</h1>
                    <p> If you're a beginner and looking to begin your next hike you may want to 
                        be sure you have all the tools for success. Depending on your hike you may need
                        different forms of gear such as a sleeping bag or snowshoes. But here you will find 
                        some of the most basic items carried by every hiker.
