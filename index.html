                <p>To start off, hiking is the activity of going on long walks, 
                    often through the country or woods, but is not limited to these areas.
                    <br><br>
                    Hiking can be as strenous as you'd like it to be, with simple hikes like
                    trekking through a nearby park, or pushing yourself to the limit on a multi-day
                    expedition through the mountains.
                    <br><br>
                    You need not any background or prior experience to start your first hike, just
                    search for a place and go (as long as you have the appropriate gear)
                    <br><br>
                    To continue to learn more information, use the navigation above to find
                    details about some of the best hikes across the United States, and the 
                    gear you may want to bring on your next hike.
