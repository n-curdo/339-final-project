                    <h1>What is Hiking?</h1>
                    <p> To start off, hiking is the activity of going on long walks, 
                        often through the country or woods, but is not limited to these areas.
                        <br><br>
                        Hiking can be as strenous as you'd like it to be, with simple hikes like
                        trekking through a nearby park, or pushing yourself to the limit on a multi-day
                        expedition through the mountains.
                        <br><br>
                        You need not any background or prior experience to start your first hike, just
                        search for a place and go (as long as you have the appropriate gear)
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                </div>
